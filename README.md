# Files-driver

Local file system driver for the [Scanner](https://github.com/vinogradsoft/scanner) library.
Allows you to traverse directories in the local file system.

## How to use?

Read the manual for using the [Scanner](https://github.com/vinogradsoft/scanner) library. Files-driver is used in a
similar way to the driver for traversing arrays (`Vinograd\Scanner\ArrayDriver`).

You can also look at the documentation for the libraries that use the driver.

- [File-search](https://github.com/vinogradsoft/file-search) - a library that allows you to search for the necessary
  files and do something with them;
- [Reflection](https://github.com/vinogradsoft/reflection) - a library that creates an object model of the specified
  directory and allows you to manipulate it: copy, modify files, delete, move and create new ones.
